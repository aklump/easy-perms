# Syntax Rules

* The pattern matching rules are the same as used in [gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format)
* If the path ends in a forward-slash `/` then only directories are matched, e.g. `/foo/bar/*/`
* If the path does not end in a forward slash then both files and directories are matched, e.g. `/foo/bar/*`
