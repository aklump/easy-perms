# Configuration

* Both YAML and JSON is supported.
* See _json\_schema/config.schema.json_ for details of the configuration.
* Notice globs are supported. So are `/**/` doubles.

1. Copy the contents of _vendor/aklump/easy-perms/init/perms.yml_ into _bin/config/perms.yml_ to get started with configuration.
