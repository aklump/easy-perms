Further, these permissions may need to be more permissive in development environments. It's time-consuming and may be confusing to keep all this in order. This tool allows you to set a baseline and then be only as permissive as necessary. It allows different configuration based on an environment. The management is simply to add paths or globs to a YAML or JSON file and then run the controller.\n\n**This project does not handle ownership of files, by design.**  It assumes proper owner and group on all files, and merely sets the octal permissions."},{"id":"install","title":"Installation","body":"## Install project with Composer at top level.\n\n```shell\n$ j a\n$ cd install\/composer\n$ grab easy-perms\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"repositories\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"path\",\n      \"url\": \".\/install\/composer\/easy-perms\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n```shell\nj a\ncomposer require --dev aklump\/easy-perms:@dev\n```\n\n## Install In Isolation Due to Top-level Dependency Conflicts\n\n```shell\nj a\ncd install\/composer\ngrab easy-perms\nj a\nmkdir -p opt\/aklump\/easy-perms\ncd opt\/aklump\/easy-perms\ntouch composer.json\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"repositories\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"path\",\n      \"url\": \".\/install\/composer\/easy-perms\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n```shell\nj a\ncd opt\/aklump\/easy-perms\ncomposer require --dev aklump\/easy-perms:@dev\n```\n\n## Controller and Configuration\n\n1. As a matter of convention, I like to create an executable file as  _.\/bin\/perms_ in any application I work on, as the single point of execution for correcting permission issues. With that in mind...\n2. First, create the controller and config files:\n\n   ```shell\n   j a\n   mkdir -p bin\/config\n   touch bin\/perms\n   touch bin\/config\/perms.yml\n   touch bin\/config\/perms.local.yml\n   chmod u+x bin\/perms\n   ```\n3. Now paste these contents into _bin\/perms_:\n\n   ```shell\n   #!\/usr\/bin\/env bash\n   s=\"${BASH_SOURCE[0]}\";[[ \"$s\" ]] || s=\"${(%):-%N}\";while [ -h \"$s\" ];do d=\"$(cd -P \"$(dirname \"$s\")\" && pwd)\";s=\"$(readlink \"$s\")\";[[ $s != \/* ]] && s=\"$d\/$s\";done;__DIR__=$(cd -P \"$(dirname \"$s\")\" && pwd)\n\n   $__DIR__\/..\/opt\/aklump\/easy-perms\/vendor\/bin\/easy-perms \"$__DIR__\/config\/perms.yml\" \"$__DIR__\/config\/perms.local.yml\" \"$@\"\n   ```"},{"id":"resources","title":"Resources","body":"* [Drupal Best Practices](https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/docs\/administering-a-drupal-site\/security-in-drupal\/securing-file-permissions-and-ownership)"},{"id":"symlinks","title":"Symlinks","body":"Symlinks may cause some unexpected output depending upon how you write your configuration.  More specifically it may appear that the same file keeps having the perms set.  This is not to worry and things are most likely working out correctly on the backend.\n\nIf permissions are failing to set, one thing to try is manually setting everything to 0755 `chmod -R 0755 ...` and then starting over with the controller file.
